📚 Regression Analysis Dashboard – Quick Start Guide
Welcome to your Regression Analysis Dashboard built with Streamlit! This guide will help you quickly set up, run, and interact with your app.

🚀 1. Setup Environment
Make sure you're in your project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd gp-regression
📦 Install Dependencies
